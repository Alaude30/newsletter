## What is it?
**Collaborative newsletter** covering the news, articles, projects coming out of the community in a digestable form. The newsletters are managed using the issues in this repository. Here is how it works:

* **Week begins** – An empty GitHub issue is opened for the given week's publication and is labeled as **upcoming**.
* **Curation Starts** – Comments section in the issue is used to discuss what is to be included in the issue/publication.
* **Week Ends** – Most interesting/important/reacted comments are picked up for the publication
* **Newsletter is Sent** – The issue is labeled as **sent** and conversation is locked.

## Who is behind this?
All the community members that participate in the issues using interesting links to news, articles, projects.

The **reason behind housing the newsletter in GitHub Issues** was to make it more collaborative and to be driven more by the community itself rather than being controlled by one person. We think that this would give us agility, self-healing, self-review and other benefits that can't be predicted now. Another cool thing is that we will have a history of all the weeklies sent before, which could be interesting for anyone subscribing at any later time.
